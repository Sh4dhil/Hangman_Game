# Hangman_game
This is a basic console-based Hangman game written in Python. It challenges the player to guess a hidden word, one letter at a time. The game displays the number of letters in the word as underscores and updates the display with correctly guessed letters. Incorrect guesses result in a series of hangman illustrations
